# Todo MFE (Microfrontend)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Microfrontend (MFE) for a simple Todo application. It is designed to be integrated into larger applications, allowing for a decoupled development approach. The MFE is built using React and TypeScript and is packaged to be consumed independently.
